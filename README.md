Welcome to my github profile. I am a highly motivated individual, eager to learn new technologies to create engaging, data-driven experiences relevant to software engineering principles. Here, you'll find my contributions and projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker, PyTorch, React-Native, and Kalman Filtering.
- 🚲 An active mountain biker.
- 🛹 An avid skateboarder.
- 🎢 Roller Coaster Enthusiast.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have ridden (200)[http://www.coastercounter.com/DOORhandle] unique roller coasters across 8 different states.

## 🚀 Projects
### <a href="https://github.com/airtimeEnthusiast/Ride_Experience" style="color: aqua;">Ride Experience Data Logger</a>

The goal of this application is to develop a data logger that will give users the ability to collect acceleration, velocity, and GPS location data in order to reconstruct a 3D path of a roller coaster's layout using SLAM algorithms. The app also allows users to view wait times at various popular theme parks using [QueueTimes.com](https://queue-times.com/pages/api) 

The current state of the app allows on-device recording with both the Apple Watch and iPhone, but the SLAM algorithms are still in development and will require extensive test data to train and optimize

### <a href="https://github.com/airtimeEnthusiast/RCDBScraper" style="color: aqua;">Roller Coaster Database Scraper</a>

The project consists of a Python web scraper that returns a dataframe of roller coaster features from RCDB. The data was used to create a retrospective study on historical trends in coaster layout designs, popular coaster models, and various statistics held by record-holding coasters. View the project here: [R Shiny App](https://wrightapps.shinyapps.io/TidyverseStudy)

The current state of the project will retrieve a dataframe of coasters located in the United States; however, other features such as a UI and categorical selection will be added in order to improve the flexibility of data retrieval.
